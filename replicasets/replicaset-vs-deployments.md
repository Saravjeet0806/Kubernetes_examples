ReplicaSet:

Ensures that a specified number of identical pod replicas are running at any given time. It can be used on its own to manage the pod replicas.
ReplicaSet does not handle updates or rolling updates. If you need to update a pod template, you would have to manually delete old pods and create new ones.
Deployment:

A higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets. It is used to handle updates, rollbacks, and scaling of applications in Kubernetes.
Supports rolling updates and allows you to manage the update process in a controlled way (e.g., can update one pod at a time).
It automatically manages ReplicaSets as part of its lifecycle, including scaling and updating the pods.
